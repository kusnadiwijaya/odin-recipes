    <h2>How to Make Chinese Tomato Egg Stir Fry</h2>
    <p>Chinese tomato egg stir-fry is a beloved classic dish that holds a special place in my heart. Growing up, it was a weekly staple at home. In fact, it is one of the few dishes my dad enjoys cooking because it has a short list of simple ingredients that transform into something delicious. This is one of those special recipes that rewards low effort with high reward.</p>
    <p>Chinese tomato egg is commonly served with a bowl of jasmine rice. The saucy tomatoes will infuse and permeate through the grains, making each bite of rice exciting. The tomatoes add a slight tang that is balanced with a little sugar, and the gently scrambled eggs add a soft, silky, and velvety texture and soak up all the delicious flavors.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound plum tomatoes (4 to 5)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 green onion, trimmed and sliced on a bias, to garnish</li>
        <li>2 cups steamed jasmine rice, for serving, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the tomatoes:</li>
        <p>Slice the tomatoes in half. Remove the tough stem from each half that connects to the vine. Cut each half into equal thirds (youâ€™ll get 6 slices from each tomato).</p>
        <li>Make the soft scrambled eggs:</li>
        <p>In a cold, 8 to 10-inch nonstick skillet, add the vegetable oil and beaten eggs. Turn the heat to medium. Once a thin layer of eggs is just beginning to cook on the bottom, push the eggs in one direction to create layers of scrambled eggs.</p>
        <p>Cook, gently stirring the whole time, until the scramble eggs are mostly set but still slightly wet and shiny, 2 to 5 minutes. Remove the eggs to a plate and, if needed, wipe out the pan.</p>
        <li>Stir-fry the tomatoes and seasonings:</li>
        <p>Add the sesame oil to the pan followed by the tomatoes and stir-fry over medium heat until the tomatoes are softened but not mushy, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken bouillon powder, sugar, and white pepper. Toss until combined and the sugar and bouillon have dissolved, about 1 minute.</p>
        <li>Add eggs, stir-fry, and garnish:</li>
        <p>Add the eggs back to the pan with the tomatoes. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes to heat through and combine. Taste, adding salt only if needed. Sprinkle with the green onions and serve with steamed rice.</p>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Make Sandwiches</h2>
    <p>One weekday evening around 9 p.m., I was craving crab Rangoon, but I didnâ€™t want to make them from scratch and takeout wasn't available. I did have a few slices of white bread, so I switched gears and turned the iconic fried dumplings into a sandwich instead.</p>
    <p>Imagine all the delicious flavors of crab Rangoon but in a sandwich. The crunchy pan-fried bread recalls the texture of a crispy wonton, and the cream cheese and crab filling gets warm and oozy, making for a fuss-free hot appetizer or lunch in no time at all.</p>
